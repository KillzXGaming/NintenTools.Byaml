# NintenTools.Byaml

This is a .NET library to handle the BYAML Nintendo data file format, allowing you to read and store the files as either dynamic objects or strongly-typed with serialized classes similar to what the .NET `XmlReader` and `XmlWriter` provide.

The library is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syroot.NintenTools.Byaml).
